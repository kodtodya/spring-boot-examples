# Examples of Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP) with SpringBoot

Most people know object oriented programming and functional programming. But
what about **aspect oriented programming** (AOP)? This repository contains 4
fully working examples
of AOP, ranging from standard Spring Aspects to custom Aspects.

## Dependencies

* Java JDK - 17
* Spring Boot - 2.7.4
* Maven

## Compile and run the web service

* Use Maven for the build process:

```sh
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
```

* Find the Swagger-UI API under:
  http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html

## Example REST calls

* Compute a Fibonacci number:

```raw
GET http://localhost:8080/api/fibonacci/40
```

* Store a String (simulate concurrency issues)

```raw
POST http://localhost:8080/api/storeData?data=hello-world
```

## Aspects for the Fibonacci computation

If you compute the 40th Fibonacci number twice, you will see the
following log:

```raw
Method [fibonacci] gets called with parameters [40]
Execution took [3379ms]
Method [fibonacci] gets called with parameters [40]
Execution took [3ms]
```

The following aspects are in play:

* `@Cacheable`: This standard-Spring annotation allows to cache previous results. As you can see above, the first REST
  call
  is pretty slow, but the second call is super fast.
* `@MonitorTime`: We use a custom aspect which measure the total execution time of our REST call and prints the result
  to the console.
* `@LogMethodName`: We use a second custom aspect which prints the name and arguments of our REST controller method.

## Aspect for a retry logic

We simulate a dadabase with concurrency issues.
Storing a String in our database creates the following log:

```raw
Method [storeData] gets called with parameters [hello-world]
Method [storeData] gets called with parameters [hello-world]
Method [storeData] gets called with parameters [hello-world]
Pretend everything went fine
```

The following aspects are in play:

* `@RetryOperation`: This Aspect makes sure that the (idempotent) method is retried until it succeeds.
  In the log above, you can see that it took 3 tries to store the data.
