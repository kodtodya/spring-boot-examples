```

## Till this point, you won't find any difference as same data you inserted will be visible

Now, lets insert the data into the Training Service. For this functionality demonstration, we have front end HTML page in place.
Please verify the logs before invoking.

### Insert Data
http://localhost:8080/index.html

Please verify the logs after invoking.

Enter data and submit, verify logs.

### Retrieve all the inserted values

    curl -X GET -H 'Content-Type: application/json' http://localhost:8080/training

### Retrieve Specific inserted values

### Delete Specific inserted values

    curl -X DELETE -H 'Content-Type: application/json' http://localhost:8080/training/0
